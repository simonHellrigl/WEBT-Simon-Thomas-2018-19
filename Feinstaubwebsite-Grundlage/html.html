<h2>What is particle pollution?</h2>
<p>
  Particulate matter (PM) refers to small solid or liquid particles floating in the air.<br>These particles can be made up of different substances like carbon, sulphur, nitrogen and metal compounds.<br>

  Generally, smaller particles are thought to be more harmful to health than larger particles.<br>Small particles can move deeper into the respiratory tract, including the lungs.<br>For this reason, fine particles that have diameters less than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) are linked to more serious health effects than larger particles.<br>PM2.5 is about one-eighth the diameter of a human hair.<br>

  PM10 includes fine particles as well as coarse particles that range in size from 2.5 to 10 micrometers in diameter.<br>The coarse particles tend to stay in the upper parts of our respiratory tract, such as the nose and throat.<br>
</p>

<h2>What causes particulate pollution:</h2>

<p>
  Particulate matter can be produced from burning materials, road dust, construction and agriculture.<br>

One of the largest sources of particulate matter in B.C. is residential wood burning.<br>Wood smoke may come from residential sources such as a fireplace or wood stove in a home, all open burning of vegetative matter or backyard burning.<br>


Other sources of particulate matter include forest fires, certain industries, furnaces, tobacco smoke and all mobile vehicles, especially those with diesel engines<br>

Tabacco smoke is very dangerous(over a long time) when you are indoor, so don't do it especially<br>
when you are in room with children<br>
</p>

<h2>The dangers of particulate matters:</h2>

<p>
  Particulate matter is considered the air pollutant of greatest concern to the health of the B.C. population.<br>Research has shown that exposure to PM can lead to increased days lost from work or school, emergency room visits, hospital stays and deaths.<br>

Both short and long-term exposures to PM can lead to the worsening of heart and lung disease.<br>It can also cause premature (early) death, particularly among people who have a higher risk of being affected by particle pollution.<br>

Those most likely to be affected by particle pollution include:<br>

-Children<br>
-Older adults<br>
-Those with heart or lung disease, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease<br>
</p>

<h2>What can we do against PM</h2>

<p>
  We can reduce the levels of particulate matter pollution by reducing the amount of particulate matter produced through smoke and by reducing vehicle emissions.<br>

Reduce the amount of particulate matter produced through smoke:<br>

-Stop smoking; if you do smoke, do not smoke indoors<br><br>
-Mulch garden refuse instead of burning it<br>
- Limit the use of fireplaces and wood stoves. When using these appliances, make sure that wood is burned properly. Use wood that is well seasoned instead of wet or green.<br>Stoves should also meet CSA (Canadian Standards Association) or EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) emission standards<br>
- Switch to cleaner burning appliances. For example, pellet stoves produce less particulate matter than traditional wood stoves<br>
- Take action to reduce wildfires. Practice safe backyard burning and careful use of campfires<br>
